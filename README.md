After volunteering for years at the Boston Latin School recycling committee, we’ve always noticed that recycling bins are overflowing with trash and not recyclable waste. In other words, no one actually cares about recycling because there’s no incentive. To prevent people from just finding a space to deposit their garbage, ruining the actual recyclable objects already inside bins, we developed EcoCoin. 

EcoCoin aims to detect if waste objects are recyclable or not, and we vision it to be implemented in smart recycling cans, where those who recycle will earn money through a QR code. The QR code will generate points and be scanned by the smart bins, where these bins will then open their lids and deposit points into the user’s account. Furthermore, we will amplify QR codes through recycling can scanning systems in more underserved areas in hopes to lower the high pollution in specific areas in Massachusetts.
